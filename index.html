            <h1>Top 8 British Tea Brands</h1>
            <br><p>I'm sure we are all aware that tea is a staple beverage of many British households, but not all teas are created equal and everyone has their own preferences when it comes down to it. There are plenty of brands out there promising the best tea experience, but which ones are the best of the best? Check out our list of 8 of the best British tea brands, all available on our website,
                 so you can tell your friends that you're drinking something special.</p>
        
   <br>     
<h1>8. Pukka</h1>
<p>Despite not being a brand that sells the standard caffeinated black tea you would expect, we still feel that
     Pukka deserves a place on this list simply because of the great variety of interesting blends available, from warming cinnamons for sleep aids, to earthy greens and energy boosters, Pukka is sure to
      have something new to try!</p>
<br>
<h1>7. Typhoo Tea</h1>
<p>Dubbed "The tea that doctors recommend" in the 1900s, Typhoo tea is now a staple on the British high 
    street supermarkets.</p>
<br>
<h1>6. Tick Tock</h1>
<p>Rooibos, a non-caffeinated tea made from the leaves of the Aspalathus linearis shrub,
     has been put on the map and in Britain's supermarkets shelves through Tick Tock. As 
     well as the original tea bags, Tick Tock have also introduced an earl grey and green
      tea blend of the classic tea.</p>

<h1>5. Clipper</h1>
<p>Originating in Dorset in the 1980s, Clipper may be one of the newer brands on this list, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most recognisable sold in the country today! From English breakfast blends, to earl grey, green and fruit teas, Clipper has a great variety of flavours and blends to suit all your tea-related needs.</p>

<h1>4. Twinings</h1>
<p>Founded by Thomas Twining in 1707, Twinings tea was one of the oldest brands on the list and has a long, rich history of supplying tea to the British monarchy. You may recognise the brand from your afternoon tea setups. The brand offers a variety of blends, including non-caffeinated fruit and herbal options.</p>

<h1>3. PG Tips</h1>
<p>First named 'Pre-Gest-Tea' before it was shortened, PG Tips was first created in 1930. In 1960, they introduced their first tea bags, that quickly started outselling the original loose leaf bags, helping the trusted tea bag us Brits know and love today become a household essential. In the 1990s, PG Tips introduced the first pyramid-shaped tea bags, with the idea that the unique shape of the bag that is reminiscent of a teapot gives the leaves more room to move.</p>

<h1>2. Tetley Tea</h1>
<p>Tetley has made a name for itself as one of the most popular tea brands in Britain, and they are also responsible for some of the first tea bags introduced to British homes!</p>

<h1>1. Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea</h1>
<p>Yorkshire tea is often regarded as Britain's most popular tea type, and Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea is no exception. Starting as a small third generation family business in 1886, the brand is now known as one the countries best-selling teas, which means they're an exceptionally popular item here at British Essentials.</p>
